# School Vaccination Portal Documentation

## 1. System Overview

The **School Vaccination Portal** is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the management of student vaccination records in schools. It enables administrators to:

- Add/manage student data
- Schedule vaccination drives
- Track student vaccination status
- Generate reports
- Export data in CSV, Excel, or PDF formats

The system supports authentication simulation and offers interactive dashboards for better decision-making.

## 2. Full Application Architecture

### Architecture Layers

- **Frontend (React.js):**
  - Components for login, dashboard, student management, drives, and reports
  - Communicates with backend using Axios
  - Styled using CSS

- **Backend (Node.js + Express):**
  - RESTful API server
  - Business logic and data processing
  - CSV parsing and file handling

- **Database (MongoDB):**
  - Stores student records, vaccination data, and drive information

### Data Flow

1. **Frontend** sends requests to **Backend APIs**
2. Backend fetches or stores data in **MongoDB**
3. Data is returned and rendered in the frontend
